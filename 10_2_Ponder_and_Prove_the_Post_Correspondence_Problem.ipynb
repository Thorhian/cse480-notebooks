This means that for that given input, their will be two valid parse trees for this CFG grammar for a single input instance. If A and B aren't a solution to the PCP problem, then only one of S_A or S_B will be the correct \"path\" if any exist."

Now, amalgamate both machines $M$ and $M_C$ into one single machine (call it $M_{combined}$) such that essentially both machines get run."
